## Description
WebSpace is a meet-up style app that gives users an opportunity to view pertinent information about other individuals attending the gathering. Whether itâ€™s just their name, company or a quick snippet about themselves, WebSpace allows users a chance to get to know a little more about their fellow attendees in an easy, non-confrontational manner.

## Future Development Plan
### QR Code Location Access
We thought it would be cool in the future if each WebSpace meetup was able to create its own QR login that members would be able to access, taking advantage of their own private group for networking.

### Messaging
Like many modern apps, messaging would be another bonus feature, allowing users the ability the network online as well as in person.
